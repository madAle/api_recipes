# This file demonstrates the possibility to provide ERB files paths as params to ApiRecipes' configuration
# ERB files will be automatically parsed when apis_files_paths option is provided into configuration
# See apis_files_paths_config.rb example

# Example of test api with minimal configuration and multiple endpoints
jsonplaceholder:
  host: jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

  endpoints:
    users:                      # This creates the endpoints: '/user' and '/users/:user_id'
      endpoints:
        show:
          path: /:user_id

    posts:                      # This creates the endpoints: '/posts', '/posts/:post_id', '/posts/:post_id/comments', '/posts/:post_id/comments/:comment_id'
      endpoints:
        show:
          path: /:post_id

        comments:
          path: /:post_id/comments
          endpoints:
            show:
